# AutomationScripts
Scripts that I created to automate the calculations for various inauspicious Hindu timings such as Durmurtham and Raghukalam to help temple priests determine when it is good to start prayer! I utilized the sunrise-sunset api to retrieve the sunrise and sunset times used for these calculations! All the info will get stored into an excel spreadsheet. Run the excel.py file to generate the calculations. In the bottom of the excel.py file is the function call that runs the computations for 2023. You can change the funtion calls to whatever year you want if you want Raghukalam nad Durmurtham for a year other than 2023.
